Now we know how to select for specific columns of data from a table, but if you had a table with a hundred million rows of data, reading through all the rows would be inefficient and perhaps even impossible.

In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.

Select query with constraints
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;
More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords (ie. num_wheels >= 4 AND doors <= 2). And below are some useful operators that you can use for numerical data (ie. integer or floating point):

Operator	Condition	SQL Example
=, !=, <, <=, >, >=	Standard numerical operators	col_name != 4
BETWEEN … AND …	Number is within range of two values (inclusive)	col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5
NOT BETWEEN … AND …	Number is not within range of two values (inclusive)	col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10
IN (…)	Number exists in a list	col_name IN (2, 4, 6)
NOT IN (…)	Number does not exist in a list	col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)
In addition to making the results more manageable to understand, writing clauses to constrain the set of rows returned also allows the query to run faster due to the reduction in unnecessary data being returned.


Exercise 2 — Tasks

ans: SELECT Title FROM movies
where Id =6;
Find the movies released in the years between 2000 and 2010
ans :SELECT title
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;
Find the movies not released in the years between 2000 and 2010
ans : SELECT title
FROM movies
WHERE year NOT BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;
Find the first 5 Pixar movies and their release year
SELECT title, year
FROM movies
ORDER BY year ASC
LIMIT 5;
