When writing WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching. We show a few common text-data specific operators below:

Operator	Condition	Example
=	Case sensitive exact string comparison (notice the single equals)	col_name = "abc"
!= or <>	Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison	col_name != "abcd"
LIKE	Case insensitive exact string comparison	col_name LIKE "ABC"
NOT LIKE	Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison	col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD"
%	Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	col_name LIKE "%AT%"
(matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even "BATS")
_	Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	col_name LIKE "AN_"
(matches "AND", but not "AN")
IN (…)	String exists in a list	col_name IN ("A", "B", "C")
NOT IN (…)	String does not exist in a list	col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F")



Select query with constraints
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;


exercise :


Find all the Toy Story movies 
SELECT Title FROM movies
where Title Like 'Toy Story%'

Find all the movies directed by John Lasseter
SELECT Title FROM movies;
where 	director = John Lasseter
Find all the movies (and director) not directed by John Lasseter

SELECT Title, Director
FROM movies
WHERE Director <> 'John Lasseter';

Find all the WALL-* movies

SELECT Title
FROM movies
WHERE Title LIKE 'WALL-%';
